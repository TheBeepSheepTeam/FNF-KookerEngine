-Foxa is 20 years old. 

-she wasn't born in a lab. she was captured by the government known as "The Greater good", for she wasn't a regular fox. 

-Foxa learned about her final form after whitty taught her the basics of singing, for she had known about whitty's ballistic form. 

-Foxa doesn't have a tail. she cut it off when she was younger due to it always getting in her way.

-Scientists actually poured a unknown liquid on Foxa. This was supposed to kill her, But instead, It humanized her, and when the scientists weren't looking, she escaped her cage. she saw her cage labeled as "Creature 07 - Foxa", she took the label and read it when she figured out how to read. 

-Similar to Whitmore, Foxa taught herself how to read, write, and speak. She learned all of this by watching other people

-Foxa's facorite food is donuts. She takes whitty to dunkin every once and a while. she collects money people drop.

-Foxa is asexual. 

-Foxa's Hight is canonically 6'3. 

-Foxa Hates Twilight Sparkle :)

-Nobody knows if foxa ever had a family, but even if anyone did know, Foxa has no idea about who they were, nor does she care. 

-Foxa MAY have feelings for Whitmore, but that is unconfirmed as of now. we just know that they are really close,
 and will tell each other anything in this universe. (The community can decide on this one lmfao)

-Foxa doesn't hate the dearests, but she strongly dislikes them along with GF and BF after what they put her through. 

-The only reason Foxa is willing to sing in her week is actually because she just wants to keep boyfriend away from whitty. She knows that Whitty is known to have a short temper, and possibly could explopde. if this had happened, updike would possibly find him and try to kill him. Luckily, Foxa was able to save him both times in this universe. 

-Foxa's body tempature is natrually 100F. She is easily capable of getting hot if the tempature around her is any higher than 100F. With this though, She takes longer to get cold. 
 
-Though the flames don't ALWAYS mean anger, If Foxa gets angry, Flames will light in her eyes. Depending on how mad she is, the flame can change different colors. She is also able to change the flame color when she wants, IF she uses more energy than usual. 

-Foxa is physically able to animate an entire city, though she may have this ability, it does not last very long. 

-Foxa has been trying to figure out how whitty's body works. She wants this information so she knows what to do if something is physically wrong with him.
