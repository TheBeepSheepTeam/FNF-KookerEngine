backstory: Foxa had gotten her name from a experimental lab, similar to Whitmore. she was captured  and sent to the lab because she was the first naturally pink fox to be seen wondering around. When she was out cold, the scientists ran tests on her, and locked her in a special cage so she wouldn't escape. However, they had poured a mysterious liquid on her as an experiment. Nothing had happened at the very moment. When the scientists escorted to the next area to look for more creatures, the action had taken place. she had turned into what seemed to be a more humanized version of herself.  She had seen clothing that was untouched, and took them as her own. Foxa had broken free from the lab to start a new life, for she had no Idea of who she even was, or what happened to her. She saw a label on her cage before she left, and took it. She learned how to write, spell, and live her life based off of what she saw other people do.  She met the dearests, and tried to sing with them, but had backfired due to massive stress. Foxa had fled, and that's how Foxa's story had taken it's place now.
